            <p> This project for DIGIT 100 was my first experience working with HTML. I’ve had prior experience with Python a few years ago, but the creativity involved in designing with HTML made me love it even more. As a new learner, I think the most significant challenge when learning HTML through GitHub was understanding all the different commands and elements. There are so many parts that make a website unique, and it takes time and practice to grasp how they work together. On the other hand, WordPress was fairly simple to learn and use. The only real challenge with WordPress was adding custom CSS to personalize the site beyond its basic templates.</p>
            <p>Customization, organization, and layout are all essential aspects of a website. With HTML and CSS, you have complete control over every detail, allowing you to design freely. WordPress however, provides a more guided approach by offering pre-made themes and templates that make organizing content easier without requiring you to write your own CSS. I would say the biggest challenge for both platforms is learning how to effectively use CSS. The skills needed to build websites aren’t too complicated but do require patience. Creating a website means constantly testing, adjusting, and refining to make sure everything looks right, which takes time and persistence. Moving forward, I’d love to learn more about CSS so I can make my future websites more creative, expressive, and unique to me.
