        <h1>My First HTML Project :)</h1>
        <h2>Things I like :D</h2>
        <h3>Music!!</h3>
        <p>One of my favorite bands is a K-pop group called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illit">Illit (아일릿).</a></p>
        <p>While I love every song of theirs, my absolute favorite right now is their latest single <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeqsjDF7Lw0">Toki Yo Tamare.</a> This was part of their Japanese release and I've been obsessed with it since it released!</p>

        <p>I made a list writing down every show I've watched and ranked them! It's still a work in progress, so the list will update occasionally! </p>
        <form action="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSgttUr7OTCg_3seyOyaS7UJOvzfEaIvdU10FNRJb4xOy4v05igCmx91NeQYROWY4svkZO9SOjDEMwN/pubhtml">

        </form>
        <h3>Games!!</h3>
        <p>I mostly play story-driven games, but I play the occasional FPS game as well! My favorite games change depending on the day, so for now this is my top 5: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Marvel Rivals</li>
            <li>Minecraft</li>
            <li>Life is Strange</li>
            <li>Valorant</li>
            <li>Animal Crossing</li>
        </ol>
        <p>My best friend and I have been mostly playing Marvel Rivals and Minecraft together, so that's why they're at the top :D</p>
